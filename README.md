# OERgame
Game created for SPARC Open Education Leadership program. 

My OER is in the form of a game. Last year I learned the very basics of the Python programming language in a workshop. At that time, I developed a simple game, and for this project, I adapted the game. This was very much a learning experience for me, as I am a true novice when it comes to coding. I created an open source repository here on GitHub for my game, and gave it a GNU General Public License v3.0. GitHub is a public repository that makes it possible to store, co-develop, and openly license code.  

I also shared the game on Repl.it, an online tool that allows me to share the code and have other users run it (play the game).  Content published on a public repl, such as my game, are automatically published with an MIT license: https://repl.it/site/docs/misc/licensing. 

I used the real-life challenges of an academic librarian working in Open Education as the “subject” of my game. While the game presents the player with scenarios and decisions we all may encounter as OER advocates, it is not intended to be taken seriously!  I wanted the game to be somewhat humorous and fun. As a librarian who has the new responsibility of leading OER efforts at my institution, I have encountered some of the scenarios described in my game.  I also looked to articles and conversations with other OER librarian colleagues for inspiration in crafting these scenarios.
